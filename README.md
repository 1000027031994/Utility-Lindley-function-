# Utility-Lindley-function-
The problem of this research becomes more complicated when the number of estimated parameters increases, which makes the estimation process numerical because it is difficult to obtain the analytical formulas. the Bayesian method estimates the coefficients of probability distributions with random variables. When estimating by Bayesian method, the estimation is either direct, using loss functions, or using utility functions, unlike other estimation methods. The issue, however gets complicated as the number of estimated parameters increases, which makes the estimation process numerical because it is difficult to obtain analytical formulas. In this paper, the paired Lindley function of three coefficients was used and applied to a multinomial distribution, the parameters were non-numeric, when estimating parameters in this way, the size of the conjugate Lindley utility function increases when the optimal approximate decisions are obtained
